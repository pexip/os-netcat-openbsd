  [ Dirk Jagdmann ]
  * Add support for abstract namespace sockets in the AF_UNIX family.

  [ Guilhem Moulin ]
  * d/t/client-server: Add a simple test for sockets in the AF_UNIX family,
    including those in the abstract namespace on Linux.  We were only checking
    sockets in the AF_INET family before.
  * d/p/abstract-unix-domain-socket.patch: Some fixes and improvements upon
    Dirk's patch.
  * d/checks: Ensure sockets in the AF_UNIX family are usable up to the
    sizeof(sun_path) limit, and rejected with ENAMETOOLONG when they exceed it.
  * d/checks: Add tests for abstract namespace sockets in the AF_UNIX family,
    incl. for source datagram UNIX domain sockets.
  * d/p/abstract-unix-domain-socket.patch: Always reject the empty pathname
    sockets, which on Linux was read as the NUL abstract socket before.  The
    empty abstract socket is still allowed however, and is specified as "@".
  * d/p/misc-failures-and-features.patch: Remove double warning in
    unix_connect().
  * d/p/misc-failures-and-features.patch: Remove leftover union{}, obsolete
    since 1.190-1.
  * d/p/misc-failures-and-features.patch: Factor out Makefile changes to
    d/p/port-to-linux-with-libbsd.patch.
  * d/p/misc-failures-and-features.patch: Remove redundant errx() call in
    unix_connect().
  * d/p/misc-failures-and-features.patch: Improve error message for UNIX-domain
    datagram sockets.
  * d/checks: Use '--' marker to avoid breakage on socket pathnames starting
    with '-'.
  * d/checks/netcat: Set LC_ALL=C.
  * Add d/NEWS entry mentioning abstract sockets support and its implications.
  * d/p/*: Consolidate usage of '#if defined(FOO)' vs. '#ifdef FOO'.
  * d/p/build-without-TLS-support.patch: Rename '-DTLS' to the less generic
    '-DHAVE_TLS'.
  * d/p/port-to-linux-with-libbsd.patch: Use automatic Makefile variables.
  * d/checks/02-connect: Check default temporary socket name for datagram
    sockets.
  * d/tests/client-server: Check that the socket path is left behind.
  * Rather than using mkstemp(3) to create unique names for default source
    datagram UNIX domain sockets, use mkdtemp(3) to create a new empty
    directory (with mode 0700) and use it to store a fixed socket name.  This
    fixes a file descriptor leak and a race condition where a new file would be
    created by an attacker between the unlink(2) and bind(2) calls.  We don't
    use an abstract socket here since it would open a race condition with the
    possibility for a local attacker to inject fake server responses.
  * d/p/*: Minor formatting fixes.
  * d/p/*: Improve Subject: lines.
  * d/copyright: Update copyright years.

    Unfortunately that test makes r-b unhappy and it's unclear why, so let's
    dump some extra information on error.

  * Minor d/rules refactoring.
  * Demote setsockopt SO_REUSEADDR/SO_REUSEPORT fatal failures to warnings.
    `nc -l` was unusable (ENOPROTOOPT) on platforms such as GNU Hurd which
    define but don't implement SO_REUSEPORT.  dh_auto_test failed on these
    platforms since d/t/client-server calls `nc -l`.

  * d/checks: Fix FTBS on some platforms:
    +  Skip entire test suite (and also d/t/client-server) on non-Linux
       platforms.  There are Linux-only dependencies, such as strace(1) and
       ss(8).
    + Don't make any asumption regarding v4/v6 preference when resolving
      localhost.
    + Don't assume getent(1) produces space-separated output.
    + Replace strace's '-Ianywhere' with '-I1' so we can run with older strace
      versions.
   + Skip TCP MD5 signatures test on unsupported platforms.  (It appears hppa
     chokes on the readpassphrase injection via LD_PRELOAD, and TCP MD5
     signature seems to be disabled in the riscv64 buildd.)

  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.6.0 (no changes needed).
  * Remove unused lintian override spare-manual-page.
  * d/checks/*: Add test suite for the upstream codebase as well as the Debian-
    specific patches.  This adds Build-Depends: iproute2, procps, strace
    (unless under 'nocheck' profile).  Parsing strace(1) output isn't ideal of
    course... but we can't think of a better way to do these checks and it's
    hopefully fine for dh_auto_test (the DEP-8 tests don't rely on that).
  * Add DEP-8 tests: 1/ ensure nc(1) is nc.openbsd(1), and 2/ basic
    client/server communication test.

    equivalent to -q 0). This is the standard upstream behavior and what
    other Linux distributions use. It is different from netcat-traditional,
    but compatibility with other versions of OpenBSD netcat is more
    important. (Closes: #502188)

netcat-openbsd (1.89-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release. (Closes: #145798)
  * Includes support for:
    - IPv6 (Closes: #461317)
    - Unix domain sockets (Closes: #348564)
    - SOCKS (Closes: #142898)
  * Conflict with netcat versions older than netcat-traditional, so that we
    can use alternatives.
  * Port some features over from netcat-traditional:
    - Exit successfully when printing help text (-h), and include the Debian
      revision.
    - Add the -q (quit on standard input EOF) flag.
    - Add support for specifying ports by name (/etc/services). Unlike the
      old hack for this, nc will first try to find a named service, then fall
      back to numeric parsing, so no escaping is needed.
